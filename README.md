# Android-App-EgisRoadPortugal
 
I don't have the complete project, when I say complete I'm referring to the final project, because the idea is fully built and the app works perfectly. Only all the theoretical part is the same, that is, all the chapters referring to the theoretical part have the same text...

This project was developed for a construction company, located in Lamego, and aimed to turn workers' learning into a digital form.
The entire app, both front-end and back-end was developed by me and my group. It was a big project for us but at the same time it was very important for our learning.
